## General Info
The war on drugs has shaped both US foreign and domestic policy. Particular attention has been paid to Mexico in the past two decades due to the security threat cartels pose to the United States. The US has provided foreign aid to Mexico for the purpose of fighting the war on drugs, and researchers have alleged that this has served to fracture criminal groups and increase violence. This project aims to see if there is a correlation between increased funding and drug related violence.
